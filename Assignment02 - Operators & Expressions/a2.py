You are developing a feature for a health and wellness mobile app that helps users understand how long they've been alive in a more tangible way.

Write a Python program that:
- Accepts the user’s age in years as input.
- Calculates the approximate number of:
  Days lived (1 year = 365 days)
  Hours lived
  Minutes lived
- Displays the output in the format:

You've lived approximately:
Days: xxx
Hours: yyy
Minutes: zzz

Sample Input:
Enter your age in years: 18

You've lived approximately:
Days: 6570
Hours: 157680
Minutes: 9460800

# for leap i should to calculate it 1 leap year have =366 days
age=int(input("Enter Your Age :- "))
leapYear=int(age/4)
livedDays=age*365+(leapYear)
livedHrs=livedDays*24
livedMin=livedHrs*60

print("You've lived Approximately")
print("Days : ",livedDays)
print("Hours : ",livedHrs)
print("Minutes : ",livedMin)
